## Pre-release 0.2.0

### What's new?

- New special kernel entry `'any'`, acts like a template for all kernels found under `/boot`.
- New flag `--remove/-r`, instead of generating entries, genuki will try to remove them.
- Strings or paths in config file can now use `{kernel}` or `{flavor}` as placeholders that will 
be replaced by the kernel or flavor value, useful for `any` entry.
